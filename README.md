# SUIToolbarPlay
Sample code for programmatically creating NSToolbar and hook it to a NSWindow

Toolbar icons are from Josh Hughes' [Perspective Icons set](https://github.com/deaghean/omnifocus-perspective-icons).

## Creating toolbar programmatically

This sample coode is base on the Xcode template when you create a macOS SwiftUI app. Changes that are relevant are in these 2 files:
- AppDelegate.swift
- Toolbar.swift

I have also created a post accompanying this sample code: https://medium.com/@billibala/swiftui-how-to-add-a-toolbar-to-window-in-macos-app-fc8da5947fe8
